conFusion Mobile
================

An Ionic-based multiplatform mobile application by 
[Sylvain Leroux](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/sylvain-leroux-5229a11a)
for the fictitious "ristorante conFusion".

Based on a project from Coursera course "[Multiplatform Mobile App 
Development with Web Technologies][2]", by Jogesh Muppala, Hong Kong 
University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The application 
provided here has many features and design changes compared to the
canonical project.

On this directory, you will find:

* A [demonstration video](conFusion-mobile.mp4) showing some of the features
of the application;
* The [Android version of conFusion mobile](conFusion-debug.apk) to test it;
* Few screencaps of the application : [Home](home.png), [Favorites](favorites.png)
and [Contact Us](contactus.png). In that later, the contact information for the
ristorante are fake. But my coordinates are correct.

Applications data are loaded from a [server on Heroku][1].  In order for the
application to work properly, you need internet access on your android device.
