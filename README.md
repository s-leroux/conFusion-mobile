conFusion Mobile
================

An Ionic-based multiplatform mobile application by 
[Sylvain Leroux](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/sylvain-leroux-5229a11a)
for the fictitious "ristorante conFusion".

Based on a project from Coursera course "[Multiplatform Mobile App 
Development with Web Technologies][2]", by Jogesh Muppala, Hong Kong 
University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The application 
provided here has many features and design changes compared to the
canonical project.

Applications data are loaded from a [server on Heroku][1].  In order for the
application to work properly, you need internet access on your android device.

Source code is available on GitHub [s-leroux/conFusion-mobile][3]
